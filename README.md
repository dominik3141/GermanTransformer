A transformer model to predict the articles of German nouns.

## Primary objective
We build a BERT-like transformer model to predict the correct articles of German nouns.
We try different sizes to determine the best size/accuracy tradeoff.

## Secondary objectives
- Determine the correct article for the word 'Nutella', answering a millennium problem in the field of German linguistics.
- Find words for which the predicted article differs with high confidence from the commonly associated one in order to find words whose articles should be reconsidered.
